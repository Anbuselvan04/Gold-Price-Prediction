# GOLD PRICE PREDICTION
Gold Price Prediction with ML Algorithms such as Long-Short Term Memory and Random Forest Regression.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

- In today’s dynamic market, gold  prices have a continuous fluctuation which results in volatile investment opportunities.
- The price fluctuations may result in financial loss, improper resource allocation, and difficulties in planning for investments in gold.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION

- The Objective is to leverage the data sets containing historical data on gold prices over a period of time and by using various visualization techniques to observe the spread and pattern of data.
- Implementing a model for gold price prediction providing accurate and decentralized forecasts through collective intelligence.

## ABSTRACT

Gold, a timeless asset, is a key element in investment and trade. Its market, driven by diverse factors, requires accurate prediction. This study offers a predictive model using historical data and various indicators. A refined machine learning model is trained, providing user-friendly real-time predictions, benefiting investors, businesses, and policymakers. This model is a valuable tool for the ever-changing gold market.

## TECHNOLOGY STACK

- Technology: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest (RF) – ML Algorithms 
- Tool: Jupyter Notebook (IBM Z PLATFORM)

## IBM Z IMPLEMENTATION

We've deployed our project on the Z platform with a focus on professionalism and reliability. This includes high availability, load balancing, redundancy, efficient resource use, comprehensive testing, compliance, disaster recovery, lifecycle management, user training, cost control, feedback loops, third-party integration validation, regular data backups, resource allocation monitoring, and a scalability plan. These measures ensure smooth operation and security on the Z platform.
